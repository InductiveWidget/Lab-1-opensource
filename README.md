Two suggestions for helpful answers
- Remember that you are not talking to yourself.  Any assumptions you may have taken for granted about a problem or solution may not be obvious to the querent.  Try to keep the answer detailed enough to avoid confustion.
- don't forget to bring in others to help answer the question if you cannot yourself. A great way to solve a problem you're not sure about is to refer the problem and querent to someone else you know who can.
